Anaconda bypasses the typical Hadoop performance issues, leverages existing high performance scientific and array-based computing in Python and now leverages Dask, the powerful parallel execution framework, to deliver fast results on any enterprise Hadoop distribution such as Cloudera &amp; Hortonworks.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>On April 13th, Dr. Kristopher Overholt &amp; Dr. Matthew Rocklin of Continuum Analytics will present a webinar on High Performance Hadoop with Python. &nbsp;</span></div></div><div class=\"lplh-22\" style=\"line-height: 22px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"lplh-22\" style=\"line-height: 22px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span>In this webinar, you'll learn to:</span></div><ul style=\"margin: 14px 14px 14px 16px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><li class=\"lplh-22\" style=\"list-style: disc outside; line-height: 22px;\"><p><span>Analyze NYC taxi data through distributed DataFrames on a cluster on HDFS</span></span></p></li><li class=\"lplh-22\" style=\"list-style: disc outside; line-height: 22px;\"><p><span>Create interactive distributed visualizations of global temperature data</span></span></p></li><li class=\"lplh-22\" style=\"list-style: disc outside; line-height: 22px;\"><p><span>Distribute in-memory natural language processing &amp; interactive queries on text data in HDFS</span></span></p></li><li class=\"lplh-22\" style=\"list-style: disc outside; line-height: 22px;\"><p><span>Wrap and parallelize existing legacy code on custom file formats&nbsp;</span></span></p></li></ul><div class=\"lplh-22\" style=\"line-height: 22px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span><span>Join us on April 13th for the webinar &amp; learn to scale up &amp; out with Anaconda.</span></span></div>", "presenters": [], "date": "Thursday, April 28, 2016", "image_file": "dask-bag.jpg", "sticky": "", "banner": "https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dask-bag.jpg", "id": "726", "categories": []}, {"utm_campaign": "", "subtitle": "Embracing Innovation without Anarchy", "image_file_path": "/Users/kstabile/.anaconda/navigator/images/journeyToOpenDataScience.png", "title": "The Journey to Open Data Science", "url": "http://go.continuum.io/journey-to-open-data-science/", "image": {"src": "https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/journeyToOpenDataScience.png", "alt": "The Journey to Open Data Science"}, "tags": ["webinar"], "uri": "http://go.continuum.io/journey-to-open-data-science/", "summary": "<h4>March 23, 2016</h4><p>Open data science languages - R and Python - offer tremendous advantages over legacy, proprietary products like SAS and MATLAB.
